# Heart Disease Predication 

Heart Disease is earier to treat when it is detected inthe early stage .
Machine learning  technique may aid a more efficent analysis in the predication of the disease.
Moreover this predication is one of the most central problem in medical , as it is  one of the leading desies related to an unhealthy .
so an  early predication of this disease will be usefull for a curve or aversion

# Dataset information : 
Each attribute in the heart disease Dataset is a medical risk factor

1-age

2-sex

3-chest pain type (4 values)

4-resting blood pressure

5-serum cholestoral in mg/dl

6-fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl

7-resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)

8-maximum heart rate achieved

9-exercise induced angina
oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
the slope of the peak exercise ST segment

10-number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy

11-thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect

12-The names and social security numbers of the patients were recently removed from the database, replaced with dummy values.

# implementation 
I have developed a baseline machine learning algorithms like AdaBoost, DecisionTreeRegressor, XGBRegressor, RandomForestRegressor,Gradient Boosting Machines,Stochastic Gradient Boosting and choose the best out of it. Then hyper parameter tuning is performed on the selected model for final model to get best results.

Final predictions are made on unseen data with the final model.
